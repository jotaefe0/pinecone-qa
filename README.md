## OpenAI Document Embedding for QA Project

This project demonstrates the use of the OpenAI API to embed documents into a vector database for question-answering tasks.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a system that can efficiently search and retrieve answers from a large collection of documents using the OpenAI API. By embedding the documents into a vector database, we can perform similarity-based searches to find the most relevant document for a given question.

## Features

- Document Preprocessing: The project includes a preprocessing step to clean and prepare the documents before embedding.
- OpenAI API Integration: The OpenAI API is utilized to generate document embeddings.
- Vector Database: The project utilizes a vector database, we will use Pinecone, to store and index the document embeddings.
- Question-Answering: Given a question, the system searches the vector database for the most similar document and retrieves the answer.
